# Run the application

To start the application, from the main folder, execute:

    cd edo-frontend
    npm install
    npm run build
    npm start

We can acces our main page in:

    http://localhost:8080

We can start developing the application in the _/edo-frontend/src/App.jsx_ file.

We have the file _/edo-frontend/stylesheets/global.css_ as the main css file for the styles (You can change it as you want).
